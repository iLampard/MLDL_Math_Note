This document is an example of how to use the accompanying files
as well as some commentary on them.
The files are {\tt math\_commands.tex} and {\tt notation.tex}.
The file {\tt math\_commands.tex} includes several useful {\LaTeX}
macros and {\tt notation.tex } defines a notation page that could
be used at the front of any publication.

We developed these files while writing \citet{dlbook}.
We release these files for anyone to use freely, in order to help
establish some standard notation in the deep learning community.

\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

We include this section as an example of some {\LaTeX} commands
and the macros we created for the book.

Citations that support a sentence without actually being used in the sentence
should appear at the end of the sentence using {\tt citep}:


\begin{quote}
One of the simplest
and most common kinds of parameter norm penalty is
the squared $\normltwo$ parameter norm penalty
commonly known as \newterm{weight decay}.
\index{Weight decay}
In other academic communities,
$\normltwo$ regularization is also known as \newterm{ridge regression}
or \newterm{Tikhonov regularization}.
\index{Ridge regression|see {weight decay}}\index{Tikhonov regularization|see {weight decay}}
\end{quote}

To refer to a figure, use either {\tt figref} or {\tt Figref} depending on
whether you want to capitalize the resulting word in the sentence.

\begin{quote}
See \figref{fig:venn} for an example of a how to include graphics
in your document.
\Figref{fig:venn} shows how to include graphics in your document.
\end{quote}



Similarly, you can refer to different sections of the book using
{\tt partref}, {\tt Partref}, {\tt secref}, {\tt Secref}, etc.

\begin{quote}
	You are currently reading \secref{sec:examples}.
\end{quote}
