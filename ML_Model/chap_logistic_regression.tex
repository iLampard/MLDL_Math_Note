\section{二项逻辑回归模型}
\label{sec:logisticmodel}



\begin{definition}
二项逻辑回归模型是如下的条件概率分布
\[
	a+b =& c \\
b+ c = &d
\label{def:logistic}\]
\end{definition}

We include this section as an example of some {\LaTeX} commands
and the macros we created for the book.

Citations that support a sentence without actually being used in the sentence
should appear at the end of the sentence using {\tt citep}:

One of the simplest
and most common kinds of parameter norm penalty is
the squared $\normltwo$ parameter norm penalty
commonly known as \newterm{weight decay}.
\index{Weight decay}
In other academic communities,
$\normltwo$ regularization is also known as \newterm{ridge regression}
or \newterm{Tikhonov regularization}.
